# College-Admission-Model

Project Objective: 
Every year thousands of applications are being submitted by international students for admission in colleges of the USA. It becomes an iterative task for the Education Department to know the total number of applications received and then compare that data with the total number of applications successfully accepted and visas processed. Hence to make the entire process easy, the education department in the US analyze the factors that influence the admission of a student into colleges. The objective of this project is to analyse the same.

Dataset Description:

GRE:	Graduate Record Exam Scores
GPA:	Grade Point Average
Rank:	It refers to the prestige of the undergraduate institution.The variable rank takes on the values 1 through 4. Institutions with a rank of 1 have the highest prestige, while those with a rank of 4 have the lowest.
Admit:	It is a response variable; admit/don’t admit is a binary variable where 1 indicates that student is admitted and 0 indicates that student is not admitted. 
SES:	SES refers to socioeconomic status: 1 - low, 2 - medium, 3 - high.
Gender_male:	Gender_male (0, 1) = 0 -> Female, 1 -> Male
Race:	Race – 1, 2, and 3 represent Hispanic, Asian, and African-American 

Objective: Analyze the historical data and determine the key drivers for admission.

Predictive Analytics: 

Finding the missing values. (if any, perform missing value treatment)
Finding outliers (if any, then perform outlier treatment)
Finding the structure of the data set and if required, transform the numeric data type to factor and vice-versa.
Finding whether the data is normally distributed or not. Use the plot to determine the same. 
Normalizing the data if not normally distributed.
Using variable reduction techniques to identify significant variables.
Running logistic model to determine the factors that influence the admission process of a student (Drop insignificant variables) 
Calculating the accuracy of the model and run validation techniques.
Trying other modelling techniques like decision tree and SVM and select a champion model 
Determining the accuracy rates for each kind of model 
Selecting the most accurate model 
Identifying other Machine learning or statistical techniques
 

Descriptive: 
Categorizing the average of grade point into High, Medium, and Low (with admission probability percentages) and plot it on a point chart.
